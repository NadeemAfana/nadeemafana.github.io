**Okta** is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management" target="blank">IAM</a> solution. It focuses on organizations complex identity scenarios that satisfy the enterprise requirements and policies. It can be overwhelming for small teams and businesses.

The biggest disadvantages of Okta include the following:
- **Initial setup and steep learning curve**: It takes considerable time and effort to implement Okta IAM. This time and effort translate into money being squandered on a non-core feature of your business.
- **Documentation**: While Okta has good documentation, it is scattered all over their websites, and it is hard to find what one is looking for without manual search.
- **Cost**: Okta is an expensive solution especially if you have a small to medium business. The pricing model is not simple and the cost per monthly active user is high and can easily exceed your budget.

## Alternatives to Okta


<a id="upend"></a>
## 1. <a href="https://app.upend.cc" target="blank">Upend</a>
<a href="https://app.upend.cc" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="/images/posts/archived/upend-screenshot.png"></a>
<a href="https://app.upend.cc" target="blank">Upend</a> is an IAM solution for individuals and small to medium enterprises. It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwordless_authentication" target="blank">passwordless</a> and  focuses on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform"  target="blank">low-code</a> and ease of integration. 

Upend supports both SSO and MFA which can be set up easily. It also provides a user portal which your end-users can access to update their info and see their login access history.

Upend advantages over Okta:
- **Cost**: Upend's cost is a fraction of Okta's. The cost per user is a lot lower as well.
- **Initial setup**: Upend is the easiest solution to set up on this list. Very small learning curve to none. In only few minutes, one can set up. A wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process and all the steps are well documented. It can be integrated with little or no code at all due to its powerful low-code features. It can be integrated seamlessly into your websites or apps using a tiny JavaScript snippet that performs all the heavy lifting for your app.
- **Use**: Easier to use since features are all organized into a single place.
- **UI**: The Admin UI is more user-friendly than Okta's. It is responsive and  mobile-friendly. Additionally, the end-user UI such as the login page can be tweaked directly using CSS styles, which you can add directly to your website. They also support bringing your own UI if needed.

<em>Upend is a great low-code and passwordless IAM solution.</em>

## 2. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/technical-overview" target="blank">Azure Active Directory B2C</a>

<img alt="" src="/images/posts/archived/microsoft-azure-b2c.png">

Azure AD B2C solution is built on the same technology as Microsoft Entra ID but is a separate service. It allows businesses to build customer facing applications, and then allow anyone to sign up and sign in to those applications with no restrictions on user account. One can customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

While Azure AD B2C is a great solution, it comes with limitations. For example, there is still a learning curve for the initial setup. Also, it is short on flexibility: It is not possible to use a custom email template or SMS for users communication. It does not seem possible to change the user name or enforce a certain format.

Advantages over Okta:
- **Cost**: A lot cheaper than Okta. The cost per user is a lower as well.
- **Use**: There is some learning curve but still easier to use than Okta.

<em>Azure AD B2C is a great solution if you don't mind compromising on flexibility.</em>


<a id="amazon-cognito"></a>
## 3. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito" target="blank">Amazon Cognito</a>

<img alt="" src="/images/posts/archived/microsoft-azure-b2c.png">

Amazon Cognito allows you to authenticate and authorize users from the built-in user directory, from your enterprise directory, and from consumer identity providers like Google and Facebook.

Amazon Cognito comes with limitations as well. For example, customizing the hosted UI is very limited. Also, Amazon Cognito relies on a user pool, which is a Cognito directory where users are stored. You can only set user attributes at the time of creation of the user pool. In case settings need to be changed, one must create another user pool, since there is no way to instantly migrate the users from one to another. Another issue is fine-grained control over features such as controlling the access token lifetime and expiration.

Advantages over Okta:
- **Cost**: A lot cheaper than Okta. The cost per user is a lower as well.

<em>Amazon Cognito is a good solution if you don't mind compromising on customization and flexibility.</em>


<a id="auth0"></a>
## 4. <a href="https://auth0.com/" target="blank">Auth0</a>

Auth0 is a platform offering IAM services for web and mobile applications which include MFA and SSO. Auth0 is aimed at developers, and it was a popular choice among developers in the past. However, after its acquisition by Okta, customers have been seeking an alternative due to its rising prices.
Auth0 is still easier to integrate than Okta. The desktop Admin UI is user-friendly but not so mobile-friendly.

Advantages over Okta:
- **Cost**: Still cheaper than Okta. The cost per user is a lower as well.
- **Learning Curve**: There is some learning curve especially for non-developers.

<em>Auth0 is a good solution if your team is made of mostly developers.</em>
