## What are Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions?
Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions streamline user authentication across multiple applications using a single set of credentials. This not only improves user experience but also enhances security and reduces the burden on IT teams. 

What are SSO Benefits?

Single Sign-On (SSO) offers numerous benefits that enhance both security and user experience:
- **Improved User Experience**: Users can access multiple applications with a single set of credentials, reducing login fatigue and frustration.
- **Enhanced Security**: Centralized authentication reduces the risk of weak passwords and makes it easier to implement strong security measures.
- **Increased Productivity**: Users save time by logging in once rather than multiple times, boosting overall efficiency.
- **Simplified Management**: IT teams can manage user access and permissions from a central platform, streamlining administrative tasks.
